description: |
  Provides information for an actual physical item. For mass produced entities which
  behave all the same, use 'product-' blocks like 'urn:sib:product-base-1'. Note that
  entities having an 'item-base' block will most likely link to one or more blocks
  (via 'links') of type 'product-*' to output all the general data. Therefore, this
  block only contains data specific to a single instance or physical product.
