  Describes links between entities. Systems like Durablox will automatically follow these links
  and join the resulting blocks together. This way, e.g. a 'urn:sib:product-brand-1' block can
  be defined only once for a virtual entity like BRAND-1 and the referenced via such a link
  block.

      May define a date "at which" this link was defined. Imagine having a singe item
      being producted at 01.07.2025. This may reference a PRODUCT entity which stores
      general information which is true for all produced items. Now, when the ITEM is
      accessed (without a specific date being specified) the data loaded for the product
      is still pinned to '2025-07-01'.
    optional: true
